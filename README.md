## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello!!!, My name is Gianni Monroy student to Systems engineering, i love Alternative Rock, Metal, Electronic 90s Music, 2000s Music, Terror Files, and videogames haha...

I have basic knowledge of Python and Bash (Command Line Base in GNU/Linux) . I used Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio 2022 Community... I work on a PC and I'm angry that they're removing Visual Studio support. My english is regular but the best way to learn is with mistakes :)

I make projects in Visual Studio Code in the Python programming language and sometimes .py and .bat scripts.

My dream is to work in a company as a Cybersecurity and Systems Engineer and mitigate the vulnerabilities in its servers and systems like Elliot, the protagonist of the Mr. Robot series :)
